udisk v0.3 11/2013 brad@heeltoe.com

This version finally works.  I watched all the bus transactions using an simple
logic analyser and they look correct.  I booted RT11, XXDP, RSTS V7.2 and BSD 2.9
from a simulated RL02 disk.

The sources here should allow anyone to rebuild the cpld and the firmware and then
flash them to the board.  The sam7utils program will write the ARM flash via USB.
You will need some sort of Xilinx jtag pod to update the cpld (I wish I had connected
the programming lines to the arm, bit I did not, sorry)

There are multiple revisions in this directory, some experiments.  Only code3 and cpld3
are currently valid.

released dirs:

cpld   WORKING STATE MACHINE CPLD **
code   WORKING FIRMWARE **

development dirs:

cpld	original async cpld
cpld2   first state machine cpld
cpld3   WORKING STATE MACHINE CPLD **
cpld4   failed attempt at SPI interface
cpld5   failed attempt at SPI interface
cpld6   failed attempt at SPI interface

code    old original code
code2   old code
code3   WORKING FIRMWARE **
code6   spi interface experiment
