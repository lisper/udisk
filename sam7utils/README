This program communicated with an AT91SAM7 device via USB (or serial)
and implements the "SAM-BA" protocol.  The protocol allows the program
to write the flash memory inside the AT91SAM7.

The AT91SAM7 should be recognized as an ACM device. When connected you
should see linux kernel messages like this:

       cdc_acm 1-1.1:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device

(note: no kernel driver is needed; it's included just for historical purposes)
