To make sure that the SAM7 interface will be recognized
by the Linux Kernel please add the following line to
/etc/modprobe.conf.local (or /etc/modprobe.conf if this
file doesnt exist):

options usbserial vendor=0x03EB product=0x6124


(Re)Plug your device to make sure it will be detected properly.
Find out which serial port its connected to (see last line
- it's ttyUSB2 in this particular case):

dmesg | grep ttyUSB
 usb 3-1: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0
 usb 5-2: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB1
 usb 1-7.2: generic converter now attached to ttyUSB2


Install the latest firmware image:

sam7 -l /dev/ttyUSB2
